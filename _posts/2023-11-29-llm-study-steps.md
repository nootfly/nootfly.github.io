Learning about Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or BERT involves several steps, from foundational knowledge in machine learning to more advanced topics specific to LLMs. Here's a step-by-step guide including resources:

### 1. **Basic Understanding of Machine Learning and Neural Networks**

   - **Resource**: Start with online courses like "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng on Coursera or "Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" on Udacity.
   - **Books**: "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop and "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.

### 2. **Deep Dive into Deep Learning**

   - **Resource**: DeepLearning.AI’s “Deep Learning Specialization” on Coursera.
   - **Books**: “Neural Networks and Deep Learning” by Michael Nielsen (available for free online).

### 3. **Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

   - **Resource**: "Natural Language Processing" specialization by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.
   - **Books**: “Speech and Language Processing” by Jurafsky and Martin.

### 4. **Learning About Transformers and LLMs**

   - **Resource**: “The Illustrated Transformer” by Jay Alammar (blog post).
   - **Online Course**: "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" on Coursera by Hugging Face.
   - **Books**: “Introduction to Transformers” by Hugging Face (available online).

### 5. **Hands-On Experience with Coding**

   - **Tutorials**: Follow Python tutorials if you're not already proficient. Websites like Codecademy, Real Python, or Kaggle are good places to start.
   - **Practice**: Implement basic NLP tasks using libraries like NLTK or spaCy in Python.

### 6. **Explore LLM Frameworks**

   - **Resource**: Hugging Face’s Transformers library documentation for practical implementation.
   - **Hands-On**: Work on projects or Kaggle competitions using Transformers. 

### 7. **Advanced Topics and Research Papers**

   - **Papers**: Read seminal papers like “Attention Is All You Need” (introducing the Transformer model), GPT series, and BERT papers.
   - **Resource**: arXiv.org and the Google Scholar for the latest research.

### 8. **Join the Community**

   - **Forums**: Participate in forums like Reddit’s Machine Learning subreddit, Stack Overflow, or join relevant LinkedIn groups.
   - **Conferences**: Follow major conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, or ACL for the latest advancements.

### 9. **Build and Share Projects**

   - **Projects**: Build your own projects or contribute to open-source projects.
   - **GitHub**: Share your work on GitHub and collaborate with others.

### 10. **Continuous Learning**

   - **Blogs and Podcasts**: Follow AI research blogs (like OpenAI, DeepMind), and listen to podcasts (like Lex Fridman Podcast or AI Alignment).
   - **Online Communities**: Stay active in online communities for continuous learning and networking.

### Additional Resources:

- **GitHub Repositories**: Explore repositories that contain implementations of LLMs.
- **Online Seminars and Workshops**: Many universities and organizations host seminars that are often free to attend.

Remember, the field of LLMs is rapidly evolving, so staying up-to-date with the latest research and trends is crucial. Also, practical experience is as important as theoretical knowledge, so try to work on real-world projects as you learn.
